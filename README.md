# DOM-wound
A DOM-based XSS demo site.

# Warning
This site was created to showcase a specific makemember vulnerability. Do not implement this page in a live setting. It is VULNERABLE.

## Vulnerable vs Exploitable 
As some of you are probably wondering, yes, this site is intentionally vulnerable for educational purposes. However, it is not easily EXPLOITABLE to cause damage to the host system. This allows an unsecure or misconfigured browser to do the "alert" script. If you put something EXPLOITY in there, expect it to exploit. Use with caution and common sense. The intention for this site is demonstration, not exploitation. 

# Education
